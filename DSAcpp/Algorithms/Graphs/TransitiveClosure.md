# Transitive closure of a directed graph and path matrix

Transitive closure of a graph G is a graph G' where G' contains the same set of vertices as G and whenever there is a path from a vertex i to vertex j in G, there is an edge from i to j in G'.

The path matrix of a graph G with n vertices is an $n\times n$
