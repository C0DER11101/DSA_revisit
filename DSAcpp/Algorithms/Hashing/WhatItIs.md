# What is hashing?

> The process of converting a key to an address(index of an array) is called hashing or key to address transformation.

In hashing, we take a key as input and return the hash value of that key which is used as the address for storing the key in the array.

Keys may be of any type(`int`, `float`, etc), but the hash value will always be an integer.

$$Key \rightarrow HashFunction \rightarrow Address$$
